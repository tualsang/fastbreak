- **Create sports events** (basketball games, soccer tournaments, tennis matches, etc.)
- **Add multiple venues** to each event (different courts, fields, or locations)
- **Search and filter** through all events by name or sport type
- **Edit their own events** and update details as needed
- **Delete events** they've created
a
Think of it as a centralized hub for organizing sports events - similar to how you might use Google Calendar for meetings, but specifically designed for sports activities.
